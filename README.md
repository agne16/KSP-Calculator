# Kerbal Space Kompanion App and Kalculator
Companion app written for iOS to aid players of Kerbal Space Program to easily calculate Hohmann transfer orbits

This project contains an application which serves as an interactive how-to guide for planning transfer maneuvers in the video game Kerbal Space Program. The application is an iOS application written in Objective-C. Includes an interface which allows the user to enter which planet they are starting from and which planet they wish to travel to. The application then calculates the ideal phase angle and ejection angle for a Hohmann transfer orbit between the two planets. The application also includes an encyclopedia which includes information about the different planets in the game.
